     *           answers). When a question gets answered, we need to get the
     *           attribute impacted by that choice.
     *
     *           Within harmony.cpp, this function allows a
     *           Personality instance to update the appropriate attribute
     *           when a question gets answered using the adjustPersonality
     *           member function.
     *
     *           To support this, this function returns the attribute associated
     *           with the selected answer (provided it is valid) so that it can
     *           be passed to the adjustPersonality member function of a
     *           Personality instance within harmony.cpp
     *
     *           answerNumber is valid of it is >= 1 and <= numAnswers
     *
     *           If answerNumber is not valid,
     *              this function returns a default constructed Attribute, i.e.,
     *                   Attribute().
     *
     *           Otherwise, it returns the attribute portion of the answers array
     *                  at index of answerNumber
     *           Remember, answers is an array (therefore zero based) and
     *           answerNumber is NOT zero-based. Make sure you adjust BEFORE
     *           you use this on the array answers.
